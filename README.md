Personal X keyboard layout of XeCycle
=====================================

Modified from Dvorak.  Numbers are on shift or caps lock; symbols
arranged for programming in JavaScript, C++, Perl, or
documentation writing in TeX.

Swapped single and double quote, because C++ prefer double ones
and the other two use both without significant preference.

Differs from the Programmer Dvorak layout (by Roland Kaufmann) in:

1. numbers retain their position.  Hit caps lock and you can type
numbers as usual.

2. exact symmetry of parens and brackets.  Parens turn out the
most used, so I placed them on the longest finger; as for braces,
when using a text editor with auto-pairing capability, rarely
does one want to type the right brace, so it is there.

3. tilde and backtick kept together.  HHKB users suffer from a
strange position of this key.
